# Curve fitting using [mpfit](https://github.com/Vindaar/nim-mpfit)

This section will cover a curve fitting example. It assumes you are familiar with the
data type and plotting introductions from the "Introduction" section. Here we will
combine this knowledge to perform a simple curve fit at the end.

With our acquired knowledge, we will now:
- read some data from a CSV file into a data frame
- perform a curve fit on the data using some functio
- compute the fit result as a line
- draw a plot containing: input data + error bars, fit, fit results

## read csv

## fit function

## compute fit result

## plot data + fit results

yes.
