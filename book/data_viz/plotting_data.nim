# Plotting data using [ggplotnim](https://github.com/Vindaar/ggplotnim)

In this tutorial we will introduce `ggplotnim`, a Nim plotting library heavily inspired
by the great R library [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org).

This will be kept rather brief, but we will discuss the philosophy of the syntax, look
at a reasonably complex plotting example that we deconstruct and finish of by (hopefully)
coming to the conclusion that the ggplot-like syntax is rather elegant.

For this tutorial you should have read the data wrangling introduction to `Datamancer` or
know about data frames and have seen the `Datamancer` formula macro `f{}`.

## On philosophy and graphics

Similar to most areas of life touched by more than a few people who seemingly all have
their own ideas about the right way to do things, plotting libraries come in different
shapes and forms. In terms of their output formats, choice of colors and style and
of most importance for us here: in terms of their API / the programming syntax used.

Most plotting libraries fall into a category that are either focused on object orientation
(your commands return some objects for you to modify to your needs) or a generally imperative
style (call this function `plotFoo` for plot style A, that function `plotBar` for style B,
etc.) and often some combination of these two.

`ggplot2` and as a result `ggplotnim` follow a declarative style that builds up a plot
from a single command by combining multiple different layers as a chain of commands.

This is because `ggplot2` is an implementation of the so called "grammar of graphics".
It's the NixOS of plotting libraries. Tell it what you want and it gets it done for you,
as long as you speak its language.

## A motivating example

Let's now consider a somewhat complicated plotting example. Using that we will look at why
it is called a *grammar* of graphics.

nbText: """
It may seem overwhelming. But it's actually simple and can be read from top to bottom.
In words all this says is:

"Create a plot from the input data frame `df` using column 'Energy' for the x axis, 'Counts'
for the y axis and color the data (both outline `color` and fill color `fill`) based on the
discrete entries of column 'Type'. With it draw:
- a histogram without statistical computations (`stat = "identity"`, i.e. don't *compute* a histogram
  but use the data as a continuous bar plot), draw them in identity position (where the data says,
  no stacking of bars), add some alpha to the color and draw it as an outline.
- a scatter plot in the center positions of each bin (`binPosition = "center"`), as the data
  contains bin edges.
- errorbars for all data of type 'background' (`data = df.filter(…)`), where the error bars range
  from `yMin` to `yMax` for all points, also in center position.

Finally, customize x (`xlab`) and y (`ylab`) labels and add a title (`ggtitle`)."

The only thing we left out is the `ggsave` call, as we only have a dummy data frame here. We
will now walk through the basic building blocks of every plot and then look at the above as
an actual plot. After reading the next part looking at the plot above again should make it seem
less dense already.

## The 3 (or 4) basic building blocks of a "ggplot" plot

There are 3 (in some respect 4) major pieces that make up the basic syntax of *every single*
plot created by `ggplot2` or `ggplotnim`. We will quickly go through these now. Keep
in mind that every option that might be automatically deduced can always be overridden.

### Input data

The zeroth piece (hence maybe 4) of a ggplot plot is the input data. It *always* comes
in the form of a `DataFrame` that contains the data to be plotted (or at least the data
from which the thing to be plotted can be computed from, more on that later). If not
overridden manually the columns that are to be plotted define the labels for
the axes in the final plot.

In addition the library will determine automatically (based on column types & heuristic
rules) whether each column to be plotted is continuous or discrete. Continuity and discreteness
are a major factor in the kinds of plots we may create (and how they are represented).

So for the next sections let's say we have some input data frame `df`.

### The `ggplot` procedure

The first proper piece of *every* plot is a call to the `ggplot` procedure. It has a rather
simple signature (note: we drop 2 arguments here, as they are left over in the code for "historical"
reasons, namely `numX/YTicks`):

```nim
proc ggplot*(data: DataFrame, aes: Aesthetics = aes(), …): GgPlot =
```

The first argument is the aforementioned input `DataFrame`. With our data frame, we can
write down the first piece of every plot we will create:

```nim
ggplot(df, …)
```

Simple enough. This doesn't do anything interesting yet. That's what the `aes` is for.

### `aes` - Aesthetics

The `aes` argument of the `ggplot` procedure is the first deciding piece of our plotting
call. It will essentially determine *what* we wish to plot and to some extend *how* we
want to plot it.

"Aesthetics" are the name for the description of the "aesthetic description" about which
data to use for what visible purpose. This might sound abstract, but will become clear
in a few seconds.

For the simplest cases (a scatter or line plot, a histogram, ...) we simply hand a (or multiple)
column(s) to draw. Depending on whether a column contains discrete or continuous data decides
how the axis (or additional scale) will be laid out.

To construct such an `Aesthetic` argument the `aes` macro is used. While it is a macro it
behaves like a regular procedure and can take the following arguments:

- `x`
- `y`
- `color`
- `fill`
- `shape`
- `size`
- `xmin`
- `xmax`
- `ymin`
- `ymax`
- `width`
- `height`
- `text`
- `weight`
- `yridges`

quite the list!

Taking a closer look at the kind of arguments gives us maybe an inkling of what it's all about.
The argument either maps to a physical axis in the plot (x, y), a "style"-like thing (color,
fill, shape, size) or some more "descriptive" thing (e.g. for sizes x/yMin/Max, width, height),
and finally some slightly "special" ones (text, weight, yridges).

What each of these mean for the final plot (again) depends on the data being discrete or continuous.

As an example:
- Discrete, each discrete value:
  - x and y: has one tick along x or y
  - color: has one color
  - shape: has one shape
  - size: has one size
- Continuous, each value:
  - x and y: map to a continuous range between min and max values
  - color and fill: has a color picked from a continuous color range
  - size:  has a size picked from a continuous range between smallest and largest size
  - shape: not supported, there are no "continuous shapes"

(for the other aesthetics also only either discrete or continuous make sense. For instance "text" is
always a discrete input, it's used to draw text onto a plot. yridges is to create a discrete ridgeline
plot, etc.)

How these are finally applied still depends on what comes later in the plotting syntax. But in principle
the mapping to more specific things to be drawn is natural. For a point plot the size determines the point
size and the color the point color. For a line it's line width and color and so on.

This part of the ggplot construction might be the most "vague" at first. But with it we can
now continue our construction. Assume our data frame `df` has columns "Energy" and "Counts" (continuous),
"Type" (discrete).

```nim
ggplot(df, aes("Energy", "Counts", fill = "Type", color = "Type"))
```

In a sense this has described a coordinate system for our plot. From the continuous / discrete columns
we can determine the data ranges ranges / classes for each "axis". Every aesthetic can
be considered an "axis" here. For example a scatter plot of `x` and `y` values that is also classified
by color using discrete column `A` and by shape using discrete column `B` is technically a 4
dimensional representation.

#### Formulas as `aes` arguments

If you paid close attention to the plot example above, you will have noticed that for `yMin` and `yMax`
we did not actually hand a column, but rather a `ggplotnim` [formula](https://scinim.github.io/getting-started/basics/data_wrangling.html). This is the main reason `aes` is a macro.

You can hand *any* formula that references local variables or column references, or simply assign
constant values (`aes(width = 5)` is perfectly valid). `ggplotnim` will compute the resulting values
for you automatically before plotting.

To summarize, you can use one of the following three things as values to `aes` arguments:
- a string literal referring to a column
- a formula computing some constant value or some operation using data frame columns
- a constant (non string) value that can be stored in a data frame

For formulas and constant values the corresponding absolute value will be computed for each
data frame entry to be plotted.

### `geoms` - Geometric shapes to fill a plot

Input data and aesthetics of course are not enough to actually draw a plot. So far we have only
stated what part of the data to use and added a discrete classification by one column (fill
and color the "Type" column).

This is what all available `geom_*` procedures are for. They return `Geom` variant objects that mainly
just store their kind and possibly some specific information required to draw them.

The (currently) implemented geoms are as follows (with the required aesthetics listed):
- `geom_point`: draw points for each `x`/`y`
- `geom_line`: draw a line through all `x`/`y`
- `geom_errorbar`: draw error bars from `xMin` to `xMax` or `yMin` to `yMax` at `x`/`y`
- `geom_linerange`: draw lines from `xMin` to `xMax` or `yMin` to `yMax`
- `geom_bar`: draw a *discrete* bar plot using the occurrences (default `stat = "count"`) of each
   discrete value in `x` or the number of counts indicated in `y` (`stat = "identity"`)
- `geom_histogram`: draw a *continuous* bar plot computing a histogram from continuous variable `x`
   (default `stat = "bin"`) or draw continuous bars starting at `x` and the number of entries
   indicated in `y` (`stat = "identity"`).
- `geom_freqpoly`: same as `geom_histogram`, but connect bin centers by lines instead of drawing bars
- `geom_tile`: draw discrete tiles at `x`/`y` (default position bottom left) with width `width` and height
  `height` each. Tiles don't need to touch.
- `geom_raster`: draw fully connected tiles at `x`/`y` of `width` and `height`. `width` and `height` must
   be constant!
- `geom_text`: draw text at `x`/`y` containing `text` (the `text` aesthetic)

Here we stated mainly the *typical* (or default) use cases. All geoms take all arguments. That means
you can also draw a histogram using points by applying the `stat = "bin"` argument. The difference
is just in the defaults! Or in case of a `geom_histogram` call you can indicate that the `binPosition`
should be `"center"` instead of the default `"left"` to have `x` indicate the bin centers.

The possibilities are almost endless. You can combine any geom with (almost) any option and
it *should just work* (few exceptions exist, e.g. `geom_raster` only draws fixed size tiles for performance).

One final thing to mention: the `geom_histogram` procedures *also* take `data` and `aes`
arguments. This means one can override the data or the aesthetics for a single geom!

#### Applying geom layers to build the initial plot

We now need to apply the input data and selection of columns to things we can actually draw.

This is where the layering structure of `ggplot` actually becomes apparent, because from here
we will list all kinds of `geoms` to draw. The order we list them directly determines
the order they are drawn in.

Step by step we will now add layer by layer and look at what happens with each to reproduce
the plot talked about in the beginning. For that purpose we will generate a data frame that we
will use in all following snippets. It will contain 3 columns:
- "Energy": a column of twice 25 elements covering the range (0, 10) with 25 entries
- "Counts": a column of twice 25 random entries between 0 and 10. The first 25 elements
  are drawn as floats (to get fractional values) and the second 25 entries will be random
  integer numbers
- "Type": simply a column that designates the first 25 rows as "background" and the latter
  25 as "candidates"

Our construction in the following is a bit artificial of course.
"""
nbCode:
  import ggplotnim, random, sequtils
  randomize(42)
  let df = toDf({ "Energy" : cycle(linspace(0.0, 10.0, 25).toRawSeq, 2),
                      "Counts" : concat(toSeq(0 ..< 25).mapIt(rand(10.0)),
                                        toSeq(0 ..< 25).mapIt(rand(10).float)),
                      "Type" : concat(newSeqWith(25, "background"),
                                      newSeqWith(25, "candidates")) })
  echo "Input data frame: "
  echo "Head(10): ", df.head(10).pretty(10)
  echo "Tail(10): ", df.tail(10).pretty(10)
nbText: """
What we want to achieve as a final plot is the following, where the explanations
are mainly due to the original motivation of where the plot example is taken from:
- a histogram for each "Type", drawn with one color each and a bit transparent so they
  are visible where they overlap. Let each bin content correspond to some data point
  at that energy.
- also plot the actual data points on top of the bins. For the "background" like data
  we have fractional values as it's values are normalized to the "candidates" (simply
  by scaling from some hypothetical time for background / time for candidate data).
- For the background data we want error bars. They represent our uncertainty of the
  background hypothesis.
- the candidates are just counts we measured. They don't have inherent uncertainties
  (from a frequentist perspective we have to repeat the experiment many times and *then*
  we can write down some variance in our candidates)

#### Building layer 1 - `geom_histogram`

So, let's start with drawing a histogram of "Energy" and "Counts":

message if a `y` aesthetic is given that user probably wants identity stats!).
Instead our data is *already* binned. We need the `stat = "identity"` option to
the `geom_histogram` call:

input data! But what's that wide gray bar spanning the whole `x` range with a

dataset, indices 0 to 24, and then again for our "candidates" dataset,
indices 25 to 49. At the intersection from the first part (index 24)
our "Energy" column is `10.0`. From there it jumps back to `0.0` (index
25) in the next bin. This leads to a full bin that accidentally covers
the full range from 0 to 10 (with a "negative" bin width if we compute
it bin to bin). Let's check that assumption by printing values between
index 24 and 26 from our data frame:

This leaves us with a single, final layer. Those of the error bars.

aesthetic args right now (which should in practice raise an exception or
draw nothing, because without limits error bars make no sense).

point. This can be achieved by assigning a formula to the `yMin` and
`yMax` aesthetic in which we describe this relationship. Start with `yMin`:

And here we are. We've rebuilt the whole plot from the beginning. Now you should have a
good idea of why this plot looks the way it does.

The great thing is that this is the whole workflow of ggplot. You won't have to search
through weird N levels deep inheritances of objects (looking at you, matplotlib!) to
figure out how to do this or that. Every other feature `ggplotnim` provides is
also handled in the same way. We just replace a few geoms or arguments or maybe add
another command. That's all there is to the grammar of graphics. Simple, but powerful.

With an understanding of the grammar of graphics, one can then essentially plot everything
that can be mapped to geometric objects and data, even for example
[a periodic table](https://github.com/Vindaar/ggplotnim/blob/master/recipes.org#fun-with-elements).
