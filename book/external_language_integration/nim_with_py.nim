# Using Python with Nim

In this tutorial, we explore how to use [Nimpy](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimpy) to integrate Python code with Nim.

There are 2 potential motivations for using Python:
* Extending the Nim Scientific computing ecosystem; mostly with Scipy / Numpy.
* Having a scripting language inside a compiled application

There is a third use case : it's implementing Python module in Nim (for example, to speed up Python). While potentially useful, we will not cover it in this tutorial but you can read go check-out
[nimporter](https://github.com/Pebaz/Nimporter).

## Using Python as a scripting language in Nim
"""

nbCode:
  import nimpy
  let py = pyBuiltinsModule()
  discard py.print("Hello world from Python..")

nbText: """
  That's basically all there is to it.
  If you don't want to use the dot operator (which can get confusing), it is also possible use ``callMethod`` directly
"""

nbCode:
  discard callMethod(py, "print", "This is effectively identical to the previous call")

nbText: """
  Most type conversion Nim -> Python will be done automatically though Nimpy templates. Python -> Nim type conversion has to be called manually with the ``to()`` API.

  Let's see how it works in practice. In order to do that, we are going to create a local Python file with our custom functions, import it in Nim and call the Python function from Nim and convert the result back to Nim types.

  The next portion will create said Python file using Nim code. If you're looking to reproduce this tutorial  at home, you can (and probably should) do it using your favorite text editor.

  Now, onto the good parts :

  As you can see, by default every Python function called will return a PyObject. To convert this PyObject into a useful Nim type simply do :
"""

nbCode:
  let nimValue = retValue.to(MyObj)

  echo nimValue

nbText: """
  Note that this example works with an object, but most Nim data structure are convertible to PyObject through Nimpy, including (but not limited to) : `Table, JsonNode, Set, OpenArray, Enum, Tuple` etc..

## Extending Nim through Scipy & Numpy

  Now that we know how to use Python through Nim, let's see how we can use Nimpy / Scipy scientific functions through Nim.

  The main difficulty is to work with the numpy ndarray type in Nim.

  In order to do that, we'll use the [scinim/numpyarrays API](https://github.com/SciNim/scinim/blob/main/scinim/numpyarrays.nim).
  By default, the conversion is done from/to Arraymancer Tensor; but the API covers ``ptr UncheckedArray[T]`` so it can be extended to any type with an underlying data buffer.

"""

nbCode:
  import arraymancer
  import scinim/numpyarrays

  let np = pyImport("numpy")
  # Create a Tensor
  var mytensor = @[
    @[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
    @[4.0, 5.0, 6.0],
    @[7.0, 8.0, 9.0],
  ].toTensor

  # As you can see, Tensor are converted automatically to np.ndarray
  discard py.print(mytensor)
  var myarray = toNdArray(mytensor)
  echo myarray.dtype()
  echo myarray.shape

  Now let's do a simple 1d interpolation using Scipy.

  For simplicity, let's use a simple, straightforward function : $$f(x) = 10*x$$ and do a linear 1D interpolation. This makes the result easy to verify.

nbCode:
  let interp = pyImport("scipy.interpolate")

nbText: """
  And that's it, for this tutorial !

  While simple, the approach presented here allows to re-use most (if not all) of the Scipy / Numpy API relying on ndarray and convert them to Arraymancer Tensor, a format easily used in Nim.
